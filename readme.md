Abstract:<br />
University environments can be a source of stress for both students and staff, leading to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. To reduce stress and associated mental health risks among students, this study proposes implementing productivity tools and methods that can turn distressing factors into sources of motivation. The proposed web application will help students manage their time, improve their grades, and mental health by including goal and priority setting,time tracking, and accessibility to assistive technologies. <br /><br />
This study emphasises the importance of addressing mental health issues among university students, with 24% of undergraduate students found to have suicide ideation. Poor performance can lead to anxiety and negative effects, while high performance can contribute to future career opportunities and help with debts. <br /><br />
The study highlights the need to manage stress and improve mental well-being, particularly among younger groups and female members of the population. Students with mental health problems become more stressed about academic demands, finances, and emotions, leading to rushed work and reduced accuracy. Mental health issues can have a significant impact on academic performance and productivity, emphasising the need to take steps to manage stress and improve mental well-being. <br /><br />
Perceived control of time is the most predictive factor for student performance, satisfaction, and burnout. Time management and critical thinking are complementary skills that can enhance productivity. The Pomodoro Technique, a time management method, employs gamification and characteristics of Agile development to increase motivation and productivity. <br /><br />
This study aimed to utilise a LAMP technology stack to develop an accessible and effective intervention for students who are having difficulty managing stress levels related to their studies. The result is an artefact uses a framework of PHP, Smarty templating engine, CSS and SCSS, as well as JavaScript to fulfil this. It is hosted on an Apache server and utilises MySQL for database management. The website is in an alpha stage which promises future use to address previously mentioned mental health issues. The proposed web application can be a useful tool to support students in managing their time and stress, aiming to enhance their academic performance and mental health. <br /><br />
Further research should focus upon the naturalistic use of this technology to assess efficacy and ease of use. <br /><br />
